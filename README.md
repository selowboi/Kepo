# Kepo

Kepo is a simple todo-list application that allows users to create, update, delete, and view their todo-list and allow them to view other todo-list.
This project was created as my final assignment at BINUS IT Divion Bootcamp and to test my knowledge about mobile development. As the result, I managed
to finished this project before the due time and got accepted into BINUS IT DIVISION as part of sokrates apps division.
